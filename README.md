This repository contains the R analysis scripts for the collaboration beween OneReach(R) and the Computational Psychopathology Research Group at Oxford.

# Notes
Chat 1 is always Anxious 
Chat 2 is always Normal
The names assigned to the chatbots are what is counterbalanced. In Counterbalance A, “Pat” is Chat 1 Anxious, “Alex” is Chat 2 Normal. In Counterbalance B, “Alex” is Chat 1 Anxious, “Pat” is Chat 2 Normal. 
The order regarding which chats are experienced first (i.e., chat 1 first or chat 2) are counterbalanced within each counterbalance-by-name. So, there are four counterbalance-groups: 
Chat 1 Anxious “Pat” First, Chat 2 Normal “Alex” Last
Chat 2 Normal “Alex” First, Chat 1 Anxious “Pat” Last
Chat 1 Anxious “Alex” First, Chat 2 Normal “Pat” Last
Chat 2 Normal “Pat” First, Chat 1 Anxious “Alex” Last
